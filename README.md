## **FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Can someone screen record you without permission?**
Yes, someone can technically screen record without your permission depending on the software they are using. However, this may violate privacy laws in certain jurisdictions.

### **Does Netflix know if you screen record?**
Netflix uses DRM (Digital Rights Management) to block screen recording on most devices. While Netflix doesn’t explicitly detect the attempt, the content often appears blacked out or inaccessible when recording software is used.

### **Does Snapchat detect OBS?**
No, Snapchat does not detect OBS directly since OBS is external software. However, Snapchat does detect internal screen recording on mobile devices.

### **How do you know if someone is screen recording your phone?**
There is generally no direct way to detect if someone is screen recording your phone unless the app provides a notification or warning.

### **Does Netflix block OBS?**
Yes, Netflix content is protected with DRM, and OBS often cannot capture Netflix streams. The recording may result in a blank screen.

### **Why does Snap say I screen recorded when I didn't?**
Sometimes glitches or internal screen recording triggers on mobile devices can prompt Snapchat to send a false notification.

### **How do I know if someone is recording me on Snapchat?**
Snapchat notifies users when someone screen records or screenshots their content, but it does not explicitly detect third-party tools like OBS.

### **Do people get a notification when you delete Snapchat?**
No, Snapchat does not notify your contacts if you delete your account.

### **Is there a screen recorder that Snapchat can't detect?**
Third-party tools like OBS Studio or external screen recorders are generally not detected by Snapchat because they operate outside the app.
